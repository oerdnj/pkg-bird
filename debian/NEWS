bird (1.2.1-1~bpo40+1) etch-backports; urgency=low

  * This is last release of bird for Debian 4.0 (etch)! Please update to
    Debian 5.0 (lenny).  Security support for Debian 4.0 has ended on the
    January 31st 2010, and so we decided to cease support for it as well.
  * For more information see: http://www.debian.org/News/2010/20100121
